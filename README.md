# Coffee-shop-Sales-2024
Hii all !!
Excited to share that I've successfully completed my first Excel project using Maven Analytics dataset that dives into Coffee Shop Sales Analysis. This project was a fantastic learning experience, enhancing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. üöÄüìä

üîç Project Highlights:

Objective: Analyze and visualize coffee shop sales data to uncover key trends and insights.

Key Insights:

‚óº Peak hours for transactions are from 8 AM to 10 AM, indicating a high morning coffee demand. The busiest hour is around 10 AM with 26,713 transactions.

‚óº June has the highest sales at $1,66,485.88, likely due to increased footfall or promotions. May follows with $1,56,727.76.

‚óº Sales are relatively balanced throughout the week, but Monday leads with $101,677.28. This could indicate a trend of people starting their week with a coffee boost.

‚óº Coffee is the top category, generating $2,69,952.45 in sales. Tea follow with $1,96,405.95.

‚óºBarista Espresso is the top seller with $91,406.2 in sales. Brewed Black Tea and Chai Tea are also popular, indicating a diverse beverage preference among customers.

‚óºHell's Kitchen and Astoria stores are the top performers, with sales of $236,511.17 and $232,243.91 respectively. This suggests these locations have a higher customer base or better marketing.

‚óº Regular-sized products are the most sold, with 45,789 transactions and an average order of 1.53. Large-sized products follow closely, suggesting a balanced preference for product sizes.

I'm thrilled with the results and the invaluable knowledge I've acquired throughout this project. Special thanks to WsCube Tech for their support and guidance.

Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuously learning in the field of data analysis! üìàüîß
